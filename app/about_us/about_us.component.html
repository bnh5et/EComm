            <h4>What we do...</h4>
            <p>This company was founded by three college students who were sick of carrying around heavy textbooks
                and paying incredibly high prices for eTextbooks. Then we created TextTrade to solve our problems.
                TextTrade provides a platform for re-selling used eTextbooks online.</p>

            <h4>Our values...</h4>
            <p>We believe that textbook publishers profit too much off of college students. After tuition, the last
                thing students need is more costs. We created our site so students can learn without having to go even
                more into debt.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <h4>Why choose us...</h4>
            <p>We offer a unique service that can cut the cost of eTextbooks. Many publishers charge very high prices
            for eTextbooks, which can be reproduced for almost nothing. This site provides a way to share eTextbooks
            without paying hundreds of dollars.</p>
